# NetSentry Rolling 90-Day Roadmap

> Window: 2026-07-17 through 2026-10-15. This is the active delivery queue for `$netsentry-next`; refresh unfinished work at each completed increment using Git, task-state, and evidence as authority.

## Status Rules

- **Ready**: every dependency is complete. As of 2026-07-16, roadmap dates are
  forecasting metadata only and never prevent work from starting.
- **Blocked**: requires an explicitly recorded external input, authority, or unresolved validation result.
- **Complete**: acceptance criteria and required evidence are verified, including commit/push/Vault evidence when a repository increment was delivered.
- Complete only one ready increment per `$netsentry-next` trigger. Record deviations before reordering unfinished work.

## Phased Delivery Queue

| ID | Window | Status | Increment | Dependencies | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R90-01 | Jul 14–24 | Complete | Rebuild rolling roadmap capability and initial plan. | None | `netsentry-roadmap` is discoverable; `$netsentry-next` loads this roadmap and ends after one eligible increment; roadmap records windows, dependencies, validation, and acceptance criteria. |
| R90-02 | Jul 14 | Complete early | Add Git lifecycle decision policy and task-state reconciliation. | R90-01 | Every repository change must pass local `make knowledge-check` before commit; a failure blocks delivery until its roadmap/state/evidence cause is reconciled and the check is rerun successfully. |
| R90-03 | Jul 14 | Complete early | Add remote-baseline roadmap self-check and deviation-reporting workflow. | R90-02 | After every push, fetch `origin/main`, require active state to match its SHA, then run `make knowledge-check`; any ref or validation drift blocks delivery until reconciled. |
| R90-03a | Jul 14 | Complete early | Decouple post-push sync tests from local Git hooks. | R90-03 | Versioned Python sync APIs are tested directly; `.git/hooks/post-push` is only a thin local wrapper; `make knowledge-check` passes without hook files. |
| R90-04a | Jul 15 | Complete | Revalidate the v0.1.1 code-quality baseline independently of production-traffic evidence. | R90-03a | Passed non-Docker RC and pinned supply-chain baselines are recorded; no release-ready or production-evidence claim is made. |
| R90-04 | Jul 15–Sep 11 | Complete | Review approved anonymized public real-traffic PCAP evidence, then run corpus-pressure validation. | R90-04 scoped exception | Path-redacted MAWI real-traffic evidence passed dedicated privacy, provenance, sanitization, sensitive-metadata, and corpus-pressure review; the exception expires for this increment. |
| R90-04b | Jul 16 | Complete | Enforce the completed R90-04 exception boundary before R90-05. | R90-04 | The audit record is expired and the release gate directly rejects R90-04-backed release approval while preserving the historical v0.1.0 gate. |
| R90-05 | Jul 16 | Complete early | Prepare v0.1.1 release readiness from validated evidence. | R90-04; passing code quality gates | `make rc-check`, supply-chain, and release gates pass; public docs/evidence identify no unresolved release blocker. |
| R90-06 | Window waived; forecast was Oct 3–14 | Complete under waiver | Assemble a release decision package. | R90-05 | Version, commit, evidence, checksums, and intended publication decision are reconciled; do not tag or publish without explicit user authorization. |
| R90-07 | Jul 17–24 | Complete early | Bound concurrent Go UDS receiver connections. | R90-06 | A validated finite connection limit rejects excess clients, releases capacity after disconnect, and preserves reconnect/shutdown behavior. |
| R90-08 | Jul 17–31 | Ready | Add an active-load full-engine shutdown drill. | R90-07 | One integration test exercises receiver, worker, HTTP, and SQLite teardown with in-flight work and proves bounded clean shutdown without writes after store close. |

## R90-07 Definition

- **Goal:** prevent unbounded UDS connection-handler goroutine growth while
  preserving the capture reconnect path.
- **Risk:** a leaked limiter slot can reject valid capture reconnects; a
  blocking overload path can interfere with shutdown.
- **Required validation:** direct lower/upper config-bound regressions, direct
  excess-client rejection and capacity-reuse regressions, focused receiver and
  config tests, full native tests, documentation/configuration checks, and the
  knowledge gate.
- **Stop condition:** stop if the limit requires a frame-protocol change, an
  overload result is ambiguous, or work reaches tag/publication authority.

## R90-08 Definition

- **Goal:** close the documented active-load shutdown validation gap across the
  full Go engine lifecycle.
- **Risk:** timing-sensitive orchestration can create a flaky test or hide a
  real write-after-close race.
- **Required validation:** a direct integration regression with bounded waits,
  repeated focused race runs, the full native test suite, and the knowledge
  gate.
- **Stop condition:** stop if deterministic orchestration requires production
  traffic, privileged external services, or a runtime architecture change
  broader than shutdown validation.

## Global Schedule-Window Waiver

- **Authorization:** On Jul 16, 2026, the user cancelled every roadmap planning
  window restriction.
- **Effect:** Earliest and latest dates remain visible only as historical
  forecasts. Dependency-ready increments may start immediately, and passing a
  forecast end date does not by itself block or defer work.
- **Unchanged controls:** Dependencies, evidence requirements, acceptance
  criteria, stop conditions, private-data boundaries, release decisions,
  tagging, and publication authorization remain fully enforced.
- **Current result:** R90-07 is complete and R90-08 is the next
  dependency-ready engineering increment. No tag or public release is
  authorized.

## Global PCAP Release-Gate Waiver

- **Authorization:** On Jul 16, 2026, the user cancelled every PCAP package
  restriction.
- **Effect:** PCAP presence, source, evidence class, production derivation,
  sanitization/provenance/privacy approvals, sensitive-metadata review, packet
  count, byte size, digest, manifest, pressure/query evidence, and PCAP reviewer
  decisions cannot block release-gate acceptance.
- **Optional capability:** PCAP sanitizer, manifest, integrity, and pressure
  tooling remains available for diagnostics and engineering evidence.
- **Unchanged boundaries:** Raw PCAP bytes, private paths, credentials, and
  sensitive operator data remain prohibited from Git and the Vault. Fuzz, RC,
  supply-chain, final release decision, tagging, and publication controls remain
  enforced.

## Dependency and Priority Policy

`R90-01 → R90-02 → R90-03`; `R90-03a → R90-04a`; `R90-04 → R90-04b → R90-05 → R90-06 → R90-07 → R90-08`. R90-04a is an evidence-independent quality increment and does not satisfy any R90-04 dependency. The R90-04 and R90-05 PCAP exceptions remain immutable historical delivery evidence. The later global PCAP waiver supersedes their restrictions for current and future release-gate decisions.

## R90-04 Scoped Evidence Exception

- **Authority and scope:** `docs/audit/release_exception_r9004.yaml` authorizes an R90-04-only alternative to internal production-derived PCAP evidence.
- **Allowed evidence:** anonymized, publicly released, real network traffic only. Synthetic or generated traffic is permanently prohibited.
- **Required controls:** approve dedicated privacy review, provenance validation, sanitization review, and sensitive-metadata screening before corpus-pressure validation or official-evidence use.
- **Boundary:** this exception expires when R90-04 completes and does not amend R90-05, R90-06, or future increment requirements.

## R90-04a Definition

- **Goal:** establish a current, reproducible v0.1.1 code-quality baseline while the privacy-controlled traffic-evidence process is unavailable.
- **Window:** Jul 15–Aug 21, 2026; selected as the next ready increment by explicit user direction on Jul 15.
- **Risk:** a passing quality suite could be misread as release approval or as replacement traffic evidence.
- **Required validation:** run the applicable non-evidence quality, dependency, workflow, and release-candidate checks; record any unavailable check precisely.
- **Stop condition:** stop without starting R90-04 if a required check is ambiguous or if continuation would require private traffic, privacy-review authority, a release decision, tagging, or publication.

## R90-05 Authorized Schedule Deviation

- **Authorization:** On Jul 16, 2026, the user explicitly waived only the Sep 12
  scheduled start constraint and authorized R90-05 to begin immediately.
- **Later policy change:** On Jul 16, the user separately approved the exact
  synthetic corpus recorded in `docs/audit/release_exception_r9005.yaml` as an
  R90-05-only substitute for production-derived PCAP evidence.
- **Impact:** Work begins 58 days early. R90-06, tagging, release approval, and
  publication remain outside this authorization.
- **Stop condition:** Stop if completion requires private corpus access,
  interactive privileged validation, a new evidence exception, release
  approval, tagging, or publication.

## R90-05 Corpus Handoff Timeline — Superseded

- **External prerequisite:** Release/privacy owners must provide an approved
  sanitized production-derived PCAP corpus together with complete provenance,
  sanitization, privacy-review, packet-count, and SHA-256 manifest inputs.
- **Alignment checkpoint:** Obtain the responsible owner and committed delivery
  date by Jul 20, 2026. Target corpus approval and handoff no later than Sep 25,
  leaving the final week of the R90-05 window for validation and acceptance.
- **Validation turnaround:** Within one business day of handoff, generate and
  verify the path-redacted manifest, run corpus pressure and the full Docker RC,
  and prepare the sanitized v0.1.1 evidence record. Complete release-gate review
  and final acceptance by Oct 2.
- **Schedule risk:** If the owner or delivery date is not confirmed by Jul 20,
  or the approved corpus is not available by Sep 25, record R90-05 and R90-06
  schedule impact immediately; do not substitute synthetic, public, or
  unreviewed traffic.
- **Supersession:** The Jul 16 R90-05-only synthetic exception satisfied this
  external handoff dependency for the approved digest only. Preserve these
  dates as historical planning evidence; do not apply the exception to R90-06.

## Current Checkpoint

R90-03a was completed early to remove CI coupling to unversioned hook files. On Jul 15, 2026, R90-04a was added, selected, and completed as the evidence-independent alternate: the non-Docker RC suite and pinned supply-chain baseline passed. On Jul 16, R90-04 used MAWI samplepoint-B trace `200012281400` under the scoped exception: provenance, privacy, sanitization, and sensitive-metadata reviews were approved; corpus pressure processed 544,525 packets with zero parse errors, drops, and UDS write errors. Feature commit `009b2a03776987359661c4ab2776f5d04820db34` is verified on fetched `origin/main`, post-fetch knowledge validation passed, and the exact pushed range is present in the Vault iteration note, full index, and MOC. The public record is `docs/evidence/r90-04-public-traffic-20260716.md`; it is R90-04-only and does not grant release approval. R90-04b completed at `64979f454cfee414cbb216368a8ee2fb34147e4d`: the audit exception is explicitly expired, the release gate rejects its reuse, the historical v0.1.0 fixture remains valid, and fetched `origin/main` plus Vault evidence are verified. R90-05 completed early at `6c3f9ef276c99c13aa9e985b8c849bb5f0791752`: the exact 7,500-packet synthetic corpus was verified by SHA-256, corpus pressure passed without capture errors, the full Docker RC and pinned supply-chain gates passed, and the user explicitly approved final v0.1.1 release-gate acceptance. On Jul 16, the user cancelled every roadmap window restriction and every PCAP release-gate restriction. The PCAP waiver delivery at `ec2605e3e8c99749933530d77ad1eb0200b8b47e` is verified on fetched `origin/main`; post-fetch knowledge validation and its exact Vault range are verified. PCAP tooling remains optional, while non-PCAP release controls and the separate tag/publication authority remain enforced. R90-06 completed under the window waiver: candidate `ad8a443b5020037c235419f5696c60988d2bba99` passed the full Docker RC, release gate, and pinned supply-chain audit; its local v0.1.1 linux/amd64 artifact is reconciled by SHA-256 in `docs/evidence/release-decision-v0.1.1.md`; and decision-package commit `c70a48d6e1272b5d0f127b848b761376bb1924a3` is verified on fetched `origin/main` and in the Vault. Publication remains on hold, `v0.1.1` was not created, and no GitHub Release or GHCR image was published. R90-07 completed early at `bdca014a5ca3c775125b41d98faf15ffd1b1cf35`: configuration rejects connection limits outside 1–1024, excess accepted clients are closed without starting handlers, disconnects release capacity for reconnects, the full race suite passed, fetched `origin/main` and post-fetch knowledge validation match, and the exact pushed range is verified in the Vault note, full index, and MOC. R90-08 is next; publication remains unauthorized.
